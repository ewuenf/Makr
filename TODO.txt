TODO:

  -> merge classes with similar functionality: CompileTask, Static/DynamicLibTask, ProgramTask ?
  -> make more convenience classes for standard configurations
  -> split examples more or make a single big example Makrfile.rb (or both)
  -> make a really simple standard project class, kind of declarative
  -> include gold and clang (with new extensions)
  -> consider using yajl-ruby over Marshal.dump for increased speed and readability of cache file
