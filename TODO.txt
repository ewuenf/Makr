TODO:
*****

  -> merge classes with similar functionality: CompileTask, Static/DynamicLibTask, ProgramTask
  -> make more convenience classes for standard configurations
  -> split examples more or make a single big example Makrfile.rb (or both)
  -> check out, if named pipes could help speed up the compile and dependencies detection process
     in CompileTask (in conjunction with -MF option of gcc)
  -> make a really simple standard project
  -> include gold and clang with new extensions
  -> change default linker to ld in gcc toolchain, not using the compiler (is this a difference?)
